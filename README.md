# Retrieve Harmful Algal Blooms Data

- The Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) in situ data are downloaded from the red tide net of the Fisheries Agency, Japan (https://akashiwo.jp/)
- The script finds all available data between the start (YYYYMMDD_s) and end (YYYYMMDD_e) dates.
- Then, loop over each point to retrieve Ancillary Data
